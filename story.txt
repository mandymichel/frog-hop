The old man rubbed his neck and stooped to grab the leather pouch. "But why would a showman help me get a kid back?"

The air in the basement seemed to drop several degrees as the opening in the hood turned toward the old man, now frozen in fear and wishing furiously that he'd just kept his mouth shut.

The old man couldn't see any part of the face under the hood, but he could feel the eyes piercing into his soul. "N..nothing. I mean, I'm leaving n..now." Straightening up he pushed the gold pouch deep into his pocket and backed toward the door. "Sir."

Finally pulling himself away from the silent figure before him, the old man stumbled down the passageway leading outside and tried to clear his head. The job didn't really make sense, but he'd done stranger things in his life for fewer gold pieces. That's not what he kept turning over in his mind.

What puzzled him was something that happened when he tried to relieve the pressure of being choked. When he grabbed the wrist and forearm of the man who hired him, he expected to grip a muscular arm.

Instead, he felt bones.

Just bones; like the arm of a skeleton.
